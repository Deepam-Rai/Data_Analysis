# Data_Analysis
This is a basic Exploratory data analysis on google playstore apps. The data was obtained from kaggle. This was done as part of the class project for my MSc in Data Science and Computing Course.

There were two available datasets - googleplaystore.csv and the another one for user reviews. I have taken only the former for the simplicity. There are 2 .ipynb files - one for data cleaning and another for Exploratory Data Analysis or Visualization.
